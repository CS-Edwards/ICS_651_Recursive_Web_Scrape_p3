# Recursive Web Scrape Project 
Recursive Web Scrap project for ICS 651: Computer Networks. <br>
findweb.py built to project spec and tested.

findweb.py webscrape searches user input site(s) for occurances of specified keyword. Recursive functionality activated with '-r' command. If recursive function is enabled, findweb.py will recurssively search all internal pages hierarchically below the root page for specified keyword. The final output is a list of sites that were scraped and the count of keyword occurances at each site. 

findweb.py takes user input from the command line.

TODO: Issue -  word count for recursive scrape not returing expected value (some times)
