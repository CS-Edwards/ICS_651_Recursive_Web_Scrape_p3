Status: findweb.py runs with bugs
Bug: For recursive searches of some sites (not all) word count varies from expected value

System: Windows 10 ; Eclipse IDE PyDev -- Python 10

Overall Functionality:
- takes command line arguments: string to search and multiple URLs
- recognizes recursive flag '-r' anywhere in command line
- non-recursive find_web runs as expected
- word count successful for non-rec search
- recursive find_web runs as expected for some sites but not for others (aforementioned BUG)
- successfully searches 'src' and 'href' attribute links, add valid links to url search
- successfully searches links hierarchically (disguards external links and links not 'below' current url)
- no infinite loops (only searches site 1x)
- detects errors: invalid urls not searched, exceptions caught and handled 
- successfully recurs through redirect page 


Notes:
**str to search is CASE SENSATIVE; for example on https://www.ics.hawaii.edu  searching for 'Computer' counts 18, 'computer' counts 3

Libraries:
import validators
import requests
import sys
from sys import argv
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from lxml import etree


###TESTING SUMMARY###
Instructions: enter text after '>' into command line (or Run Config in IDE) to begin tests
First argument must be string to search
ie: $python [FILE PATH]/Project3/findweb.py [arg1_String] [arg2] [arg3] 

MAKEFILE has two examples of how to run program, additional test listed below
